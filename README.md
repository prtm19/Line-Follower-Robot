Hello Everyone,
<hr>
I designed a robot that autonomously follows a black line path with IR sensors. Arduino integration for in-time control and decision-making, and an L293D motor driver for the accurate motor action. This project enhanced my sensor integration, motor control, and embedded C programming skills.
Thank you!
